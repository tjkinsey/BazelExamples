# BazelExamples
Unit testing with bazel using Java and C++

I created two example directories to show (on a very basic level) how bazel works with unit testing for java and c++.

In order to run bazel you will need to download and install bazel.

Documentation for bazel is [here] (https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-overview.html)
